# fundraiser_dapp_core
The core functionality repository of the fundraising dapp.

While this is not the complete dapp source code (to discourage outright forks), it does contain enough code to recreate the business logic for such kinds of app: donation followed by tokenization.

NOTE: This code is used in a modified version on the Crowd FLOW dapp, and is subject to change. We encourage enthusiasts to try clone the repository and try tweak the code, but we are not responsible for any scaling, storage or securiry issues in case the code is reproduced de facto, without added devops, security or data storage functionality, which have incorporated, but not open sourced.
